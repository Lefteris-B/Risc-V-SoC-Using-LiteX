As part of this work, a SoC with RISC-V open-source architecture processor will be designed and developed using new synchronous design flow software.
The target technology is Intel's FPGA technology provided by the laboratory. 
LiteX will be considered as a modern design stream, which is a SoC design stream 
and at the same time a HARDWARE IP library hosted on GitHub and providing utilities
that can be used to create SoC in FPGA.
LiteX IP components are described entirely using Python,
which simplifies its design. LiteX already supports various soft processor cores
as well as basic peripherals, without dependencies on closed source IP or code generators.

SUBJECT AREA: Implementation of a RISC-V core with an FPGA. 
KEYWORDS: FPGA, LiteX, Python, RISC-V, SoC.
